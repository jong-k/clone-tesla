        Feeling mad hostile, ran the apostle, flowing like Christ when I speak
        the gospel. Shame on you when you stepped through to The Ol Dirty
        Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo. Rae got it going on pal, call me
        the rap assassinator, rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger.
        Protect Ya Neck, my sword still remain imperial before I blast the mic,
        RZA scratch off the serial. My beats travel like a vortex through your
        spine, to the top of your cerebral cortex.
